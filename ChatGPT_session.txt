I am designing a cookie clicker video game to educate people for finanicial literacy.  We are using socks as a metaphor for currency, because the game world has not invented shoes, and there is a moth infestation.  Both of these are metaphors for inflation.   

The video game's main character is a bollywood star that did something bad, then escaped to a different country which is a metaphor for the united states.  initially, the character moves into a cardboard box, and loses socks over time because there are no shoes in this world.  They walk by a laundromat and find they can do chores to get socks.  This is level1, where the number of socks in the user's account is in the single digits.

Once the user gets to 10 socks, they hit level 2.  They now live in a van and pedal a pedicab to make money.  Both of these use up more socks, yet yield more socks as the user clicks.  

At this point, the user's bollywood agent back home got out of jail (because they were implicated in the unspecified bad thing the user did), and is now the custodian of one million socks of royalties from the user's previous bollywood career.  For (possibly unspecified) reasons, these socks are not fungible with the socks in the user's country.  

At this point, the game needs to introduce mechanics which are analogies to loans and investments, to demonstrate the power of compound interest and to show the long-term effects of how good financial decisions can prevent predatory lending, and grow wealth.  

We need to extend these ideas out to several more levels, because have to produce a 2-3 minute video illustrating a compelling story that demonstrates that the app being built will be entertaining and effective at tricking the user into learning about how compound interest can have profound positive and negative effects in the real world.

This is a fantastically creative concept ‚Äî quirky, metaphor-rich, and with real educational potential. To design a 2‚Äì3 minute narrative that showcases the engaging and educational power of your game, we need to:

    Extend the game world in a few more levels to illustrate financial mechanics.

    Introduce metaphors for loans, interest, investment vehicles, risk, and scams.

    Structure a short, compelling arc that sets up the story, introduces a choice, and shows the long-term consequence of financial decisions.

üéÆ Game Levels Outline (Levels 3‚Äì7+)
Level 3: The Sock Bank & Sock Loans

    Setting: A quirky ‚ÄúSock Bank‚Äù run by a friendly goat.

    Mechanics Introduced: The player can now take sock loans.

        Loans can be taken to upgrade the pedicab into a "sockmobile" (increases socks per click).

        But moths (representing interest) nibble a few socks every minute ‚Äî the longer you delay paying back, the more socks you owe.

    Teaching Moment: Understanding interest on debt.

Level 4: Compound Interest Island

    Setting: A mysterious island where socks multiply if you leave them alone long enough.

    Mechanics Introduced: Sock Investments ‚Äî user can "deposit" socks into ‚ÄúSock Plants‚Äù that grow slowly, then faster (compound interest curve).

        At first, the user is tempted to pull the socks out early.

        But the game graphically shows how much more they‚Äôd earn by waiting longer.

    Teaching Moment: Power of compound interest (positive side).

Level 5: The Loan Shark (Predatory Lending)

    Setting: Dark alley with a neon-lit sock vendor promising ‚Äúinstant sock riches.‚Äù

    Mechanics Introduced: The player can take a risky loan that explodes in repayment terms.

        Initially gives a huge sock boost, but repayment terms are brutal and sock loss is exponential if not managed.

    Teaching Moment: Recognizing predatory lending, hidden terms, ballooning interest.

Level 6: The Bollywood Sock Market

    Setting: International sock exchange where the Bollywood agent offers a deal.

    Story Beat: The agent wants to "invest" the user‚Äôs earnings back home in India, but they must understand currency exchange, conversion loss, and foreign investments.

    Mechanics Introduced:

        Introduce sock derivatives and volatile markets (gamified, exaggerated for humor).

        Create a visual of a ‚Äúsock blender‚Äù turning beautiful cashmere socks into shredded lint if poorly timed.

    Teaching Moment: Risk vs reward, diversification.

Level 7: Sock Retirement Home

    Setting: Player can now build a comfy slipper factory (finally inventing ‚Äúshoes‚Äù) that protects socks from moths.

    Mechanics Introduced: Passive income from past investments.

        The more they invested wisely in earlier levels, the more relaxed and sock-rich they are now.

        If they took predatory loans and didn‚Äôt learn, they‚Äôre stuck patching socks endlessly for a living.

    Teaching Moment: Long-term financial planning and retirement savings.
